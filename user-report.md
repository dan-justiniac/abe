- I asked codex to delegate a simple dev task to a worker codex using the platform.
- It never came back until the job was done (did it do it by itself? it was my impression)
- I've been prompted so many times to validate codex commands, my fingers are hurting
- I have no clue if the job was done

As a user, I'm expecting that codex returns as soon as the worker was
  succesfully launched, ready for my input. It should not block until
  completion. It should never need my consent to execute commands inside the
  platform. It doesn't need to report each and every worker move, but if I ask
  for job status, it can answer straight away.
